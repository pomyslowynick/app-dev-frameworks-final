<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is the final project for Application Development Frameworks module in CIT Software Development course, I have received 99% mark for it. 

It uses web UI to allow users to manage a database of movies and directors, with different levels of permissions depending on their status. Thymeleaf is used as the templating language in the HTML files. Lombok reduced the number of boilerplate code in POJOs. JPA is used for the database management.
